# Freelance Apps Hub

A compact hub of my **freelancing mini-apps** now opened up as **open source** - built for real clients (schools, students, tuitions, gyms, institutes, small orgs, developers).  
Stack: **HTML + SCSS + JavaScript** inside each app, **React (Vite)** shell.

## About this hub & background

Over a long career in **freelancing**, I've built dozens of small, purpose-built tools for real clients.  
Now I'm **open-sourcing** many of those **apps and app parts** so others can learn, reuse, and adapt.
